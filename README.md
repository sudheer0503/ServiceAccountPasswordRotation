# ServiceAccountPasswordRotation
We use service accounts day to day in our production / engineering systems. Enterprize active directory would expect you to change the passoword every 'x' days. Using any vault and CD solution (I am using Azure KeyVault here), you can rotate it every day to reduce manual maintanance overhead.
